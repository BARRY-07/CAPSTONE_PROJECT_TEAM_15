# Financial Graph Mining for Customers & Supply Chains Assessment

## Project Presentation

### Introduction

BNP Paribas, with a significant presence in 75 countries and employing over 189,000 people, specializes in Retail Banking and Services, as well as Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB). This project aims to enhance CIB activities by focusing on the strategic analysis of clients' transactions and supply chain mapping of corporate customers. Understanding these supply chains is pivotal for improving risk management, client relationships, and maintaining a competitive edge.

### Objectives

This project seeks to:
- Visualize and summarize the supply chains of BNP Paribas clients in a specific sector.
- Predict potential future clients based on current transactions.
- Identify supply chain vulnerabilities that could disrupt the market.
- Detect hidden supply chain links not immediately apparent from the data.
- Assess Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores based on supply chain interactions.

### Methodology

Participants are encouraged to utilize various Python libraries and algorithms, with a particular interest in exploring the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for analyzing supply chain networks.
